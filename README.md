Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.

An inferential statistical analysis was performed on this unsourced dataset to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.

According to the data presented, there is a definite bias in hiring callbacks based on white-sounding names, and black-sounding names. This is the case even if the resumes sent in are identical, but have different names on them. According to the data, white names would receive about 3.1 more callbacks than black names out of 100 people.

These results do not mean that race is the most important factor in callbacks, but it is a significant one. To understand the different factors involved in determining callbacks, a multivariate analysis needs to be performed.

The results are explained <a href='https://github.com/shubacca/Racial-Discrimination-Data/blob/master/EDA_racial_discrimination/sliderule_dsi_inferential_statistics_exercise_2.ipynb'> here. </a>
